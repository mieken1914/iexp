This is an expert system that revolves around iPhone damages.
The system asks the user for inputs about the damage in a form
of a question and answer format. Once the Q&A is done,
it will give a recommendation.

This contains:
-iexp folder (which is the system to be used)
-iexpert_db.sql, a database export
-and some screenshots

Installation:
1. Copy the "iexp" folder on the htdocs directory in your xampp folder.
2. Import the "iexpert_db.sql" database file on mysql. This contains the 
initial or starting database for the expert system.
3. Open the Internet Explorer browser since this only works on this specific
browser.
4. Then inside the iexp folder, there is a file, "connect.php". Open this
and change the $servername, $username and $password according to your pc's xampp mysql database
credentials.
**this is the text inside the file, connect.php:
	$servername = "localhost";
	$username = "root";
   	$password = "";
	$db_name = "iexpert_db";
 	$con = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $db_name) or die("Failed to connect to MySQL!" . mysql_error());
